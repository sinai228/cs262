Description: Displays a UI for a user to give an input name, whose age increases by one for each button click, using EXPO CLI (iOS simulator)

We use the elements Button, FlatList, concat, and useState, TextInput, and more.


What is the name of the component in this application?
  * The name of the component in this application is the useState App.js

Name one prop and one state element in the code.
  * One prop is the View style and one state element is the birthday.

How are curly braces ({}) used in the JSX code.
  * Curly braces are used to represent that the value within the curly braces must be processed for some kind of function. For style property, the curly braces accept an object, and outer braces are also needed.

Identify one anonymous function in the code.
  * One anonymous function in the code is the   handleClick = () => {setAge(prevAge => prevAge + 1);.

Does the application, when run on either Android or iOS, use HTML and/or CSS?
  * The application runs using Javscript, without HTML and CSS, when rendered on either the Android or the iOS.
