2. a). No, I haven't.
b). Yes, I have used Slack for a semester when I was on a team project with Calvin StartUps, as a design team leader. I used it to upload the application and web layout,
To communicate, and put out ideas.
I have also used Github, but only to upload files and look up references.
c). I'd like to work on an online/remote study app that allows users to search, collaborate, and even make bets. I'd also like to work on a "craigslist" app where people can buy, sell, trade, and donate things to people in the same dorm, community, area, and the world..!

Openness 77%
Conscientiousness 56%

b). I’d love to work with Zachary Chin, Haram Koo, HyeChan Jun.
4. I’d love to see my ideas actually coming to life, and develop a
user-friendly app so that there may be actual users other than the
developers using it.☺️ I want this semester of team project
to be a time of improvement, hard work, and a semester where
I learned the most in terms of communicating, coding, looking at the app
from a user-point-of-view. I want to be able to say,
“I made !!! app that does !!! in CS 262,” when asked,
“What did you learn in college?”.
